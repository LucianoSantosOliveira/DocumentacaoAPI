            <h1>Cloudflare API</h1>
            <p>To get started using Cloudflare's products and services via the API, refer to <a href="#">how to interact with Cloudflare</a>, which covers using tools like <a href="#">Terraform</a> and the <a href="#">official SDKs</a> to maintain your Cloudflare resources.</p>
            <p>Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows who is making requests and what permissions you have. <a href="#">Create an API token</a> to grant access to the API to perform actions. You can also authenticate with <a href="#">API keys</a>, but these keys have <a href="#">several limitations</a> that make them less secure than API tokens. Whenever possible, use API tokens to interact with the Cloudflare API.</p>
            <p>To create an API token, from the Cloudflare dashboard, go to <a href="#">My Profile</a> &gt; <a href="#">API Tokens</a> and select <strong>Create Token</strong>. For more information on how to create and troubleshoot API tokens, refer to our <a href="#">API fundamentals</a>.</p>
